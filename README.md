# ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning Repository**

This repository contains the assignments of me, Faiz (AI Engineering @ ITS'23), for my Machine Learning course. Some are group assignments and therefore may have additional contributors apart from me.

Here's a brief overview:

1. [kmeans-youtube](./tugas1_kmeans_yt/): This is the first week's assignment for the course, I did this with Addin and Rasyad, it was on doing K-Means clustering on dense vector representations of youtube video descriptions.
