# ▶️ **Youtube Description K-Means Clustering**

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure that the `../uni-damin/` submodule is linked/cloned, basically, check if the folder exists there, if not, clone it. The data that the notebook uses is contained there.

Most of the explanation is done in the `.ipynb` file, the data that we use is recycled from my Data Mining course assignment, see [here](../uni-damin/tugas1_youtube/).  
The recyled data is used for semantical clustering on dense high-dimensional vector representations of youtube video descriptions.
